    // FIXME: this mechanism has to be put in place because of a flaw in the api.
    //        The server keeps returning feed pages until page 99, and starts returning a 422 staus code (Unprocessable Entity) after.
    //        Although starting form around page 56, and on until page 99, the server keeps returning a feed page with empty data.
    //        Yet increasing the number of pages reported in the metadata, as if there were actually more next pages.
    //        IMO the api should signal this event to the client by the same sort of behavior adopted in the previous page case.
    //        Just like current and previews page will both be 0, when there are no more previous pages.
    //        So the current and the next page should have the same page number in case there are no more available next pages
    
    //        I do also have further questions about the naming conventioin between next and previous.
    //        It could be more straightforward to think about these in terms of publication date.
    //        This is quite the case already, in the sense that the articles are ordered by published date
    //        Although there is a bug: in some of the pages the article at index 0, will have a timestamp
    //        that is older than the article at index 1; and then correctly decreasing towards earlier timestamp,
    //        But bug aside, it occurs to me that it somewhat confusing and logically reversed, the fact that to fetch
    //        "older" articles the client would have to fetch the *next* page (rather that the previous).
    
    //        So this is definitely something I'd like to discuss with the backend engineers.
